Purpose:
Determine electric field at a location

Inputs:
A quadratic function of XYZ with bounds in each direction
Shell thickness for conductors
Net charge of object
Number of points to approximate object with
Location to calculate field

Outputs:
Field at inputted location
Text files containing point data for plotting

Project also contains accompanying MATLAB script for plotting, wrtten by Caleb Howell.



Fun facts:
- I did not know that the field of computational electromagnetics existed at the time of writing this.
- This was my first C++ project
